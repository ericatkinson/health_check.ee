"Surprise Highway":http://surprisehighway.com

This accessory displays information about the configuration and general health of your EE system. It also checks the file permissions of key system files and upload directories and lets you know if anything is setup incorrectly.

It may be useful for system maintenance and troubleshooting. One possible use is to copy and paste the output into an EE or add-on support request so you can get help faster.
